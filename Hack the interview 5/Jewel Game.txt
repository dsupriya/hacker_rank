You're playing a game in which you're given a sequence of various jewels. If adjacent jewels are of the same type, you can gain 1 point by collecting them (thus removing them from the sequence).

Given a string of lowercase English letters, where each letters represents a different type of jewel, find the maximum score you can obtain by playing the game optimally.

For example, if  = "abccbda", you can play as follows:

Collect "cc". These jewels are removed, the string becomes "abbda", and your score becomes 1.
Collect "bb". The string becomes "ada", and your score becomes 2.
After this, it is impossible to collect any more jewels. Therefore, the answer is 2.

Explanation 0

In the first case, we first collect "dd". The jewels now become "abccbd". Then collect "cc" followed by "bb". The jewels now become "ad", and no more jewels can be collected. The final score is , which is the maximum score possible.

In the second case, it is not possible to collect any jewels.
