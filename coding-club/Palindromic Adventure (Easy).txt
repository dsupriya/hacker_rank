Please note that easy and hard version have same theme but are actually different questions

Ayush loves strings, especially palindromes. He was given a string, he wishes to know the longest palindrome he can make with the characters of the string, but he wants that string to be lexicographically smallest string.

For example, if s = "abcdab", few of the possible pallindromes are a,b,aba,bacab,abcba Out of longest palindromes, we need to select lexicographically smallest one, thus answer is "abcba"

Input Format

A single string of lowercase characters only

Constraints


Output Format

Output the lexicographically smallest pallindrome which is longest in length

Sample Input 0

xpnwijf
Sample Output 0

f
Explanation 0

There is no pallindrome possible from characters of input of length greater than 1

Among all possible pallindromes of length 1, "f" is lexicographically smallest

Sample Input 1

gvgqdi
Sample Output 1

gdg
Explanation 1

Longest length possible is 3 only, possible pallindromes are 1. "gvg" 2. "gqg" 3. "gdg" 4. "gig"

"gdg" is lexicographically smallest

Sample Input 2

golsg
Sample Output 2

glg
